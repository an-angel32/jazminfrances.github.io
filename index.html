Most would consider my main friend group to be relatively small compared to others. But although, I have many friends, my trio is the one I stick with the most. In fact, we three first became classmates in 7th grade. However, we only became close during 8th grade when our seats were placed together. From that moment on, cracking jokes became easier and helping each other study became the norm. Not only that, we are all low-maintenance friends, so being absent from each other's presence will not easily diminish our friendship.

These experiences taught me how to balance fun and responsibility, and they made my high school life more colorful. Every laughter and challenges we faced together became a reminder of how much I’ve grown throughout the year.

My family is mainly composed of my parents, my siblings, and my father's side of the family.

Each of my family member's characteristics vary. My father and his family are goal-driven and protective of their loved ones. They also seem to share the same love language, which is gift-giving. As for my mother, she leans more on expressing her love through physical touch. She is caring but sometimes worries too much. Lastly, my siblings are alike but can have differing opinions at times, leading to arguments. However, they both do well with their studies, despite being lazy like me.

My family is serious when it comes to family events. During Christmas and New Year’s, the table is filled with food, while the space below the tree is cramped with presents. We strictly follow family traditions, like wearing only red on New Year’s. During every major holiday, everyone and everything should be well-prepared.
